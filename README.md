# FrogCode

## To make it work, you need to have this:

```
npm install xterm
npm install socket.io
npm install express
npm install express-session
npm install node-pty
```

and have Docker installed correctly.
Unless you did some weird tricks that allow to run Docker without sudo, you need to
run this with sudo.

Before you run this, run: `sudo docker pull python:3.7` so that terminals start
immediately.
